1. Split definition of BSTs into unique (left subtree is <) and non-unique (left subtree is <=).
3. Try to refactor BinomialHeap2.v.
4. Reorder stuff in BTree.v.
6. Get rid of TODOs.
7. Get rid of Admitted.
8. Get rid of Abort.
10. Implement height-balanced BSTs.
11. Implement weight-balanced BSTs (and rename them to size-balanced).
13. Do something about perm <-> Permutation equivalence (prove, remove, whatever).
15. Refactor Ord to be more Haskell-like.
