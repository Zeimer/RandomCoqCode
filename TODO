1. Split definition of BSTs into unique (left subtree is <) and non-unique (left subtree is <=).
3. Try to refactor BinomialHeap2.v.
4. Reorder stuff in BTree.v.
6. Get rid of TODOs.
7. Get rid of Admitted.
8. Get rid of Abort.
13. Do something about perm <-> Permutation equivalence (prove, remove, whatever).
15. Refactor Ord to be more Haskell-like.
16. Define more functions for "easy" finger trees and prove more lemmas.
17. Define general finger trees.
18. Implement more stuff from Okasaki's book.
19. Implement height/size-balanced BSTs.
20. Derive balanced BSTs from the general definition.
21. Investigate dependently-typed variants of data structures.
22. Automate proofs wherever tactics like isBST/Elem/isHeap etc. are missing.
